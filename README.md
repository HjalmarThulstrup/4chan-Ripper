# 4chanRipper
I made this script so you nice and easily can download all media files from a specified 4chan thread.

To run the script, you need to have Python 3.7 plus a few modules installed:
	
	beautifulsoup4
	argparse
	urllib
  
To run the script, type in the following command:

	python3 downloader.py [url]

For help, type in:

	python3 downloader.py -h
